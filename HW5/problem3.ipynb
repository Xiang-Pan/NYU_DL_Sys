    "In this problem we will follow Kubeflow-Kale codelab (link below). You will follow the steps as outlined in the codelab to install Kubeflow with MiniKF, convert a Jupyter Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines, and run Kubeflow Pipelines from inside a Notebook. For each step below you need to show the commands executed, terminal output, and screenshot of visual output (if any). You also need to give a new name to your GCP project and any resource instance you create, e.g., put your initial in the name string."
